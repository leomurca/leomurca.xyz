## TL;DR

WebViews in native Android development can be used for a variety of purposes, but some of the best use cases are:

1. Provide information in your app that you might need to update, such as end-user agreement or a user guide;

2. Display web pages such as news articles, social media feeds, and web-based applications, within your app.

3. Authentication: If your app requires authentication with an external service, you can use WebViews to display the login page and handle the authentication flow.

(INVALID) 4. Payment gateways: You can use WebViews to display payment gateways within your app. This allows you to accept payments from within your app without the need to redirect users to a separate website.

4. HTML5 games: If your app includes HTML5 games, you can use WebViews to display them within the app.

5. Advertising: You can use WebViews to display advertisements within your app. This allows you to monetize your app by displaying ads without the need to leave the app.

6. Custom UI elements: You can use WebViews to create custom UI elements within your app, such as custom buttons or menus.

7. Chatbots: You can use WebViews to display chatbots within your app. This allows users to interact with chatbots without leaving the app.

8. Implement a MVP: If you want to validate an idea but you don't have enough android engineers to implementa all natively, just port your existing web app to Android webview.

Overall, WebViews can be a useful tool for integrating web-based content and services into your native Android app.
